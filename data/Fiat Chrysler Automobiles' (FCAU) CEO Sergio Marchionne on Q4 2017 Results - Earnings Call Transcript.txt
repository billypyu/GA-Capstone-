Good afternoon or good morning ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to today's Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' 2017 Full-year Results Webcast and Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Joe Veltri, head of FCA Global Investor Relations. Mr. Veltri, please go ahead, sir.

Joseph Veltri

Thank you Steffi and welcome to everybody who is joining us today. You will find the presentation material we will go through along with the related earnings release posted under the investor section of FCA's group website. Our call today is going to be hosted by our Chief Executive Officer, Sergio Marchionne and Richard Palmer, Chief Financial Officer. After their presentation, we will be holding the customary question-and-answer session.

Before we begin, I would like to point out that any forward-looking statements we might make during today's call are subject to the risks and uncertainties mentioned in the Safe Harbor statement that can be found on Page Two of today's presentation and as always the call will be governed by that language.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Sergio Marchionne.

Sergio Marchionne

Thanks Joe. I'm going to keep my comments to a minimum this morning before I pass it on to Richard for detailed look at 2017.

A couple of things, one as you well know this in a fourth year in our five year plan that we launched back in 2014. And I think we went back and looked at some of those skepticism that was expressed back in 2014 over the likelihood of us making these numbers for 2017 and 2018.

And I think, as a management team, I think we feel relatively good about the fact that now we haven't missed a year since the plan was launched and we have maintained an upgraded guidance notwithstanding the fact that we have lost Ferrari for the midst.

So overall we feel pretty good about what we have been able to achieve for the first four years of the plan. The important thing is that we now are in the final stretch of this five year exercise, and we can see the 2018 numbers as we originally laid out, not only doable but obviously we need to do a lot of work especially in North America to make sure that we execute well on the reindustrialization of the U.S. manufacturing footprint.

We have launched Wrangler in Q4 of 2017, we are in the midst of starting up the production of the new pickup and we are in the midst of the launching, revised and upgraded Cherokee. These are key elements of our commercial activities in the [indiscernible], which still constitute as you can talk from the numbers, the largest portion of the operating income performance of this house.

Joe will [indiscernible] couple other the comments have come back from the analysts at least some of the first reads from the data. Before this and I just wanted to give you one, I mean we are never going to spend a lot of time doing this.

We are not going to reconcile the P&L for you, and if people are looking for the impact of the tax reform and are upgrading the guidance, we will wait until the third quarter of this year, as we have normally done at which point we will give you an upgraded view, where 2018 will be.

The important thing is that the numbers that we laid out are doable. I think we are looking forward to finally - hopefully walking into this meeting in Q2 and telling you that we no longer have debts.

That’s something that Richard has taken on as a personal sort of objective to beat everybody into a - that every mechanism in the second quarter of this year, to make sure that we can shed this detract history that we have had now for a quite a while. So I think it’s going to be a big day here, when we get there.

The important thing is to understand - and I have looked it by the way guidance coming from our competitors. I think there is a very strong likelihood that we will outperform Ford in terms of operating earnings in 2018, and that’s something that if I told any of us in the room here that would have been doable five years, nobody would have believed this.

So we feel relatively good about what’s going on, lot of work to be done in the next 12 months. We are confirming June 1 as the date in watch do the upgrade for the plan till 2022. It will be done in Europe, probably it will be done in the local which is where the original sort of plan in 2004 was launched, so it’s going to be an interesting anniversary.

But I think the important thing is that for us now is to complete what we started back in 2014 to deliver 2018, properly and to set the stage for the next phase of growth of the group and on that basis, I’ll pass it on to Richard, he will take you through the intricacies of 2017.

Richard Palmer

Thanks very much. So a good day to everybody on the call, moving to page three, on the slide deck. We have a summary of the 2017 highlights. So as mentioned before this was the fourth year of our five year plan that we issued in May of 2014 and upgraded in January 2016, following the spinoff of Ferrari. The results were another record for FCA, and do mean that we have met all the key targets in the first four years of our business plan.

Our adjusted EBIT was up to €7.1 billion, and our margin grew up 90 basis points, 6.4%. our cash flows were over €2 billion for the year, and we reduced our net debt down to €2.4 billion. The NAFTA capacity realignment is proceeding, we started production of the new Jeep Wrangler in Q4 and we will be starting production of the Ram 1500, and the new Jeep Cherokee in Q1 of this year.

We also introduced a new Alfa Romeo Giulia and Stelvio in most of the major markets for the premium customers, we got some movement from our friends of the rating agencies on the ratings, Moody’s and S&P both move it our outlook to positive from stable and which upgraded us.

And on the basis of the 2017 results, and of the product actions I mentioned earlier, our 2018 guidance confirms our business plan key target, with net revenues at around €125 billion, adjusted EBIT in access of what we call to 8.7 billion, adjusted net profit of around €5 billion and net industrial cash of around €4 billion.

Moving to Page four, a little bit more information on the key product launches for 2018. So the new Wrangler is in the process of being ramped up in production at our Toledo North plant. It’s an all new vehicle. It has a modernized design, but maintains its heritage as the icon of the Jeep brand, it will have an all new two liter turbo with an eTorque Mild-Hybrid linked with the new high speed automatic transmission. So very important vehicle obviously for the Jeep brand.

Then we move on the Ram 1500 which is also all new, the key vehicle for the Ram brand. This vehicle will be built at Sterling Heights with the commercial launch in this first quarter of 2018. We believe it’s most technologically advanced pickup in the market. It features all new design both exterior and interior and also this will come with an eTorque mild-hybrid Powertrain.

We will also be launching a new version of the Jeep Cherokee, which will be built in Belvidere following the move and also this product will have an all new advanced four cylinder turbo engine and that vehicle will also be launching in the first quarter of this year.

And finally in Latin America, we have been substantially absent from the B segment sedan area of the market. We will be launching the new Cronos built in Argentina for Latin American distribution in the first quarter of 2018, which will complete to a large extent the renewal of the Fiat passenger car line up in Brazil with we have a new Mobi launched last year actually late 2016, Argo launched last year and the Cronos now launching. So lots of product news, important product new for 2018.

Moving to Page Five, we see the financial summary for full-year 2017. So our consolidation shipments were down about 60,000 units driven by NAFTA which was down 196,000 units all which 150,000 was due to planned U.S. fleet reductions principally due also to discontinued models that’s 200 Dart and the Patriot.

Our LATAM shipments were up 65,000 driven by the new Jeep Compass in [indiscernible] and the new Mobi as I mentioned earlier and EMEA was also up 60,000 units. Our combined volumes were up 20,000 units due to an increase of around 80,000 units mainly due to the Chinese JV which was up 44%.

Our revenues were flat at €111 billion. Adjusted EBIT was up 16% to €7.1 billion I mentioned earlier. Our adjusted net profit was reached €3.8 billion up 50% and our net profit doubled to €3.5 billion following the strong operating performance and also reduction in financial charges as we deal with the balance sheet. Our gross debt was down including some FX transaction effects by about €6 billion through the year.

Our net industrial debt as I mentioned earlier closed at €2.4 billion, down from the €4.6 billion we closed 2016 at. And our available liquidity remains very strong at €20.4 billion of which €7.6 billion is the revolver and committee credit lines.

Moving on next to Page Six. We show the details of the improvement in adjusted EBIT of €1 billion in the year. All the segments contributed positively to the year-over-year improvement. Although APAC did benefit from the insurance recovery from the [indiscernible] that we have talked about in the year.

The margin improvement of 90 basis points to 6.4% was driven by all segments, with NAFTA reaching 7.9% margins EMEA up 3.2% margins and Maserati 13.8% margins with also LATAM starting to see some improvement in margins with the market conditions getting better in Brazil reaching 2.3%.

The chart also shows the year-over-year improvement was substantially driven by improved sales mix on the bottom chart which was basically the key driver in all regions and also from Maserati. We have the discontinuation of the lower margin vehicles in NAFTA. We have the strong performance from Ram and Grand Cherokee. We had increased volumes in [indiscernible] in Brazil for Latin America where we make the Jeeps and Toro Pickup. And also our [indiscernible] volumes from Maserati.

The pricing negative was substantially driven by the impact of the pound sterling in the EMEA markets and the U.S. dollar RMB weakening impacting Maserati partially offset by positive pricing in LATAM to cover cost inflation.

Moving to Page Seven. This shows the improvement in net industrial debt during the year. Our industrial EBIT improved year-over-year by €880 million, it's a €12.7 billion and increase of 7%. Margins were up to 11.7% compared to 10.8% for the prior year.

Financial charges and taxes improved by €700 million mainly due to a reduction in financial charges of €0.5 billion as a result of the gross debt reduction I mentioned earlier and utilization of tax credits and deferred tax assets on the tax line reduced cash taxes by €200 million.

Our working capital was negative for the year, mainly due to an increase in inventories due to ramp up of vehicles at year-end including the Alfa Stelvio and the new Wrangler. Our CapEx for the year was consistent with the prior year number at about €8.7 billion and FX and other includes the benefit of the sale of our stake and [CHI] (Ph) in the first quarter and some positive FX impacts on our cash flow hedges.

Moving to the segment on Page Eight. We start with NAFTA. Overall NAFTA performed well in 2017 we have a strong focus on mixed improvement offsetting reduced volume due to the planned reduction in fleet volumes I mentioned earlier and discontinuation of Dot 200 and Patriot.

Margins improved 50 basis points to 7.9%, and our overall market share was down in the U.S. due to reduced fleet volumes while retail shares was substantially flat. Q4 was substantially flat year-over-year, with the U.S. stronger 18.2 million vehicles and Canada also strong two million vehicles.

Our U.S. dealer inventory days was slightly higher year-over-year, but this was basically driven by the lower fleet sales and also roll - our absolute inventory number was down 12,000 units, in U.S. dealer inventory.

Shipments was down as I mentioned earlier, driven by the fleet, decrease and the discontinuation of the product. Notwithstanding that, our net revenues were down only 3%, offsetting some of the 7% reduction in shipments, due to a favorable mix of vehicles and channels. So our adjusted EBIT as I mentioned was up to 50 basis points.

You can see in the work underneath that notwithstanding the 186,000 reduction in volumes, we offset that by positive mix both in terms of the products and also substantial improvement in sales mix with retail mix up to 80% of total U.S. sales versus 75% in the prior year.

We had some level of positive pricing in the year, largely offset by incentives and our industrial costs were negative, and we had good performance from the sourcing organization and lower D&A and warranty costs, these were offset by the cost for the capacity realignment plan which is substantially complete, we still obviously are completing the launch of the light-duty truck in sterling Heights. And some higher product costs for content enhancements on the campus and the Pacifica our new models.

Moving to Page Nine, Latin America, Brazil industry was up 9% year-over-year and to 2.2 million vehicles for the year and in the fourth quarter was up 14% year-over-year, so an improving trend in Brazil, Argentina was up 26% for the year and in Q4 showed a continued growth at around 20% versus the prior Q4.

Our market share was down in Brazil from 18.4% to 17.5% mainly due to discontinuance of Palio vehicles and the ramp up of the Argo launched in July. In 2018 as I mentioned before, we will be launching the Fiat Cronos in the first quarter which is important for our passenger car share as well as the full-year the Argo will also support share in 2018.

Inventories were down slightly from the end of Q3, but slightly up compared to the end of last year, ready frankly to manage the launches I talked about and also the improving market conditions we are seeing in Brazil.

Shipments were up 14% driven by the Mobi, the Argo and the Jeep Compass and as a result our revenues were up 24% at constant exchange with the extra growth compared to shipments due to improved vehicle mix.

Adjusted margins were up 1% to 1.9% from breakeven in 2016 basically driven by the volume increase and the positive mix due to 45,000 of the 65,000 unit increase being related to the Jeep Compass launch out of [indiscernible].

Moving to Asia Pacific on Page 10. For the year, the industry was up 1% in China and Australia and 9% in India which was heavily impacted by the improvement in the SUV segments of 27% year-over-year.

For Q4, China was flat, Australia was up 3% and India was up 6%. FCA combined sales were up 19% and Jeep sales reached 240,000 units in the region up 35% year-over-year and accounting for 87% with our sales in the region.

Consolidated shipments and revenues were down around 9% and this was offset overall by our improvement in our JV shipments up 44% due to the launch of the new Compass. Adjusted EBIT margins were up to 5.3%, but as I mentioned earlier excluding the Tianjin insurance recovery, the number would have been 2.5%.

We had a positive mix effect for higher Alfa sales while the launch of Alfa and the non-repeat of the Tianjin sell down that we completed last year and also some positive pricing impacts due to non-repeat of discounts related to the sales of those damaged vehicles.

Industrial costs were up as we invested in the launch of the Alfa and Mayo vehicles and had negative transaction impacts for the - dollar and the Chinese RMB. SG&A was also up as we support the launch of the Alfa brand in the region.

Moving to Page 11. We can look out the performance of EMEA. EMEA was up 5% in terms of sales driven by also the market which was up 3% for passenger car in EU and 6% for LCV. Our inventories were stable at 71 days in line with the prior year number. Our shipments were up 5% to 1.36 million units driven by the launch of Alfa and of the Jeep Compass as well as continued improvement in volumes of the Fiat Tipo family.

Revenues increased 4% to €22.7 billion and our margins were up from 2.5% to 3.2%. As you look and walk below, important contribution both from volume and mix as the Stelvio, Compass and Tipo positively impacted our profitability also negatively impact on pricing more than half of which was driven by the GB pound devaluation impact year-over-year for which last year we had some hedge cover as you see in the left. And then on the industrial side, strong performance on purchasing savings and manufacturing helped us to continue to improve our margin performance.

Moving to Page 12. We see Maserati had a good year for the brand with sales up 22% and also shipments up 22%. Our adjusted EBIT was up 65% for €560 million with a 13.8% margin for the year large partly this improvement was driven by continued improvement in Levante volumes, which is driving strong mix and EBIT performance through the brand.

Moving to Page 13. You can see that performance of our components business. Revenues were up 5% adjusted EBIT was up 20% with a 15% improvement in our margins to 5.3% from 4.6%. All businesses showed some volume growth in particular strong performance from [indiscernible] in lighting and in chassis business lines as well as a good efficiencies on the manufacturing side from [indiscernible].

On page 14, we turn our attention to 2018. The industry outlook shows overall, we expect stable to positive markets with improvements expected to continue in LATAM, slight improvements in APAC and EMEA and NAFTA forecast slightly down, both strong in terms of overall margin, overall volumes.

NAFTA you can see we are forecasting at 20.7 million units, down from 21.2 million in 2017 with a U.S. market strong at 17.3 million units and Canada at two million units. Latin America, as I mentioned, we seeing the improvements in Brazil in the second half of 2017 and we are expecting Brazil to get 2.4 million units up from 2.2 million in 2017 and so overall LATAM volumes up to 4.4 million from 4.1 million in 2017. Asia Pacific substantially flat and EMEA up 0.5 million units with the EU 28 up driven by Italy and France with some decline in the UK and Spain.

On Page 15, just a couple of comments about the impacts of the U.S. tax reform. In 2017, we didn't have any significant impact as we close the books to show the effect of tax reform. Our net income was reduced by €88 million due principally to the deemed repatriation tax being booked.

Obviously as you know this tax will be paid over the next eight years and we had an immaterial of benefit as we revalued our deferred taxes since we have a small deferred tax liability in the U.S. and so a slight benefit to income of that revaluation.

Looking forward to 2018, as I mentioned earlier, we substantially use all of our losses in credits through the end of 2017 in the U.S. The impact on 2018 guidance as we have already mentioned is a saving compared to the prior year --of about €800 million which takes our effective tax rate to about 25% for 2018.

Other considerations we don't expect any other significant impact and no impact on the deductibility of our interest expense or also based a really a minimum tax as our impressions on both of these items are substantial.

Moving to Page 16, I think. To reiterate our 2018 guidance. We are confirming our business fund targets for adjusted EBIT, adjust net income and net industrial cash as they were upgraded in 2016 following the spinoff of Ferrari.

Our top-line growth will be driven by the launches of the new products, some of which I mentioned earlier, clearly key to our ability to reach these targets is the execution of product ramp ups in the first half of the year of Jeep Wrangler around 1500 and the new Jeep Cherokee in the U.S.

in the U.S. and just to be clear, there are obviously the U.S. dollar against the euro does create some headwind for us, we are basically assuming in this guidance a raise of 120 and there would be some negative impact against the numbers if we continue to see a weakening of the U.S. dollar.

The revenue increase substantially driven by NAFTA as I mentioned on the key products, all our business segments are expected to improve margins, with NAFTA confirming its target from the business plan at around 9% up from 7.9% we saw in 2017 also EMEA at around 4% confirming.

Maserati is targeting 15% level and components also confirming a 6% LATAM and APAC are below the targets that we had in the business plans but showing year-over-year improvements.

With that, I will concluded my remarks and I will handover to Joe, to start questions. Thank you.

Joseph Veltri

Thank you Richard, with that, Steffi I think we are ready to take some callers in the queue please.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Certainly, thank you. [Operator instructions]. We will take now our first question from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.

Shreyas Patel

Hi, this is Shreyas Patel on for Rod. I have a question regarding NAFTA, just the latest round of negotiations are currently underway, and I was curious you have any thoughts on where thing stands and how you think about FCAs exposure. We know about the schedule relocation of the heavy-duty Ram to Warren in 2020, but I was just curious is that the level of component sourcing from Mexico and maybe just some of the products being built down there.

Sergio Marchionne

There is no easy answer to your question, because it is incredibly complex. Let me put it this way, I think that based on what we know, even if I look at the bid as positions in some of the U.S. administration and were the other jurisdictions are positioning their views on. Once we relocate the heavy duty truck out of Mexico into the U.S. I think we will be fine and I think our exposure to any potential tax associated with the withdrawal of U.S. from NAFTA is manageable.

Certainly not enough for us to change our forecast. So I think that the issues are more complex, because it - we have had a chance now to look at these the Canadian proposal that were sort of released yesterday. And our view is that that at least within the structural all is being proposed by the Canadian there appears to be the beginning of the solution to this problem. I think we believe we can –a lot of the data that’s contained on a Canadian proposal is also about quantifying, I think is left for a linear negotiation.

But the concept embedded in the Canadian proposal is [indiscernible] I think this all notion of moving away from some of the antiquated terms that we used in NAFTA back in the 90s, is a good thing. It’s very difficult for us to tell you whether those things going to be successful or not.

I think the U.S. has been trying to get a repatriation of the build of components and cars back in the United States I don’t know how successful. I mean Certainly, by us bringing back to heavy duty we have done a lot because I think we are adding out to have 1,000 jobs back into Michigan and having the Mexican asset that we gave to something else is an important part for the solution.

I think that we are getting closer so I think that’s ultimately manageable, but I think there is a lot of negotiation and needs go on. I’m encouraged by what I see from the participate I think was round on negotiation that’s underway in Montreal, Bayer’s promise and that’s way until.

Now, the U.S. certainly has been negotiating very heavily on those issues. I think we need to be careful that they don’t press too hard and in fact end up doing more damage than we, but I think we are moving in the right direction. I think the Canadians will try to help.

Shreyas Patel

Okay. And then just one last may be for Richard. How should we will be thinking about commodities in 2018 it’s affecting obviously some of your competitors but I’m just curious about the impact at least for FCA?

Richard Palmer

Yes, so we have an impact to about 1.2% in terms of a negative impact overall APV which is equivalent to about €850 million. We are relatively confident in terms of the sourcing organization. We can continue to more than offset that number getting to a gross savings excess of that and also offsetting with some of the positive impacts of the lower costs in NAFTA for the realignment for the capacity which clearly was substantially completed in 2017. So whilst we do see commodity prices up, we don’t think it’s an issue to offset them with other efficiencies.

Sergio Marchionne

Well just to translate all then to a very simple statement. We are not modifying items on the basis of a commodity price increases I mean it’s built into our calculation history how much is actually obtainable on purchasing between technical and commercial savings and on that basis we are positive compared to 2017.

Shreyas Patel

Okay. Thanks.

Operator

Thank you. We now take a question from George Galliers from Evercore ISI.

George Galliers

Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask around the free cash flow. If I take your net cash target of 4 billion and look at the delta where you finished net debt in 2017, it would implies free cash flow of around 6.4 billion. So you just give an insight into what you are expecting in terms of working capital this year and also CapEx for 2018?

Richard Palmer

So George in terms of working capital, you saw that in 2017 we had a negative impact on working capital with the volumes were flat and also we had a lot of launches at the end of the year. So we are expecting working capital to improve to a positive number around €2 billion for 2018 based on the volume growth and also some optimization in terms of inventories as we get through the launch process.

In terms of CapEx, we closed the year 2017 €8.7 billion and we are expecting a number to come a little lower than that in 2018 as obviously in 2017 we had those significant programs such as the Wrangler and light duty Ram. So we are expecting a number between €8 billion and €8.5 billion.

George Galliers

Great. And then just on the tax savings. The €800 million which you’ve flagged, is that a similar number both in terms of the P&L impact and the cash impact for with that specific to the P&L.

Sergio Marchionne

It's the similar number in terms of both P&L and cash compared to the prior regime applied to the 2018 guidance. So if you calculate the cash charge on 2018, with or without the tax reform we get a benefit both in cash and in tax charge.

Year-over-year, we do have an increase in cash taxes in the U.S. notwithstanding the benefit of tax reform because as I mentioned, we used our credits that we had accumulated and also some deferred tax assets in the U.S. So our cash taxes we expect to go up from about €0.5 billion in 2017 to €1.2 billion €1.3 billion in 2018. Does that make sense to you?

George Galliers

Yes. And it's make sense how you describe it yes. It just.

Sergio Marchionne

That's why [Technical Difficulty]. Gas taxes are up 2017 to 2018, they are not on an accounting basis from 2017 to 2018 just to be clear.

George Galliers

Right.

Sergio Marchionne

So the P&L is going to reflect the better tax charge in the cash pool. The cash pool will be in excess of 2017. And it's built into the number, and it's built into the number of €4 billion of tax that we are forecasting for the end of 2018. Alright, are we clear?

George Galliers

Got it yes. That's clear. Thank you.

Sergio Marchionne

Good.

Operator

Thank you. We now move on and take our next question from Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please go ahead.

Brian Johnson

Yes. Thank you for taking the question. I want to continue our kind a dialogue around pickup trucks that we could on several recent calls and the auto show. And so we talked at the auto show about the plan to run out lower end push at the low end of the market and in the past, I pretty clear with the you connect where you're heading at the higher end of the market with the ramp.

That's a very similar strategy of course there were so [indiscernible] is heading. But I wanted to get your sort of perspective we have got and we have heard this from one of your competitors just take halls, that brand loyalty is so high in the pickup truck market.

It's unrealistic for competitors to think that they're going to get share away from I would to describe is the nation's top selling truck. So how you thinking about the brand loyal is. Is there is some pent up demand as they wait for the new Ram. How do you think about the jump all segment and positioning the Ram there?

Sergio Marchionne

Go ahead. I'm intrigued by Richard’s answer for the question, go ahead.

Richard Palmer

As the Ram brand -. So I think you saw the truck that we unveiled in Detroit.

Sergio Marchionne

Look we are not going to answer until discussion, a couple of data points and then we can pull it to back. The first one is, that when we started this process back at the beginning of this cycle, back in 2009, 2010, we have actually increased share by about 50% in the pickup truck market. So, and we picked up that share in a growing markets, well technically that growth was available to everybody, the fact that we have picked up and positioned Ram backed in [indiscernible] in this market is a good sign.

I’m not interested by the way in starting a share war in the United States, that is not or the objective is with the new truck is probably is not the objective in keeping the older version of the Ram in place, it was design to try to cover a market need, especially on the fleet in the commercial fleet side would be ill suited by the technology that is now embedded in the new pickup trucks.

So, whoever was on the call yesterday was claiming, from our competitor was claiming so that the importance of brand loyalty and the inability to dislocate [indiscernible] adults from the truck, god blessed them. I mean, I don’t want to sort of the start that view of that brand and I think if they accomplished they got more power to them.

I have really very humble ambition of trying to position what I consider to be the most technologically advance truck in the marketplace and then selling the bottom end of the same on the commercial fleet side which something which is both priced and the technologically relevant, so that segment and nothing else.

Don’t drag me into a discussion about - market share, what we are going to do Ford, to GM, we are still [indiscernible] we are just going to do our best and nothing we will leave at that. Does that answer your question Brian.

Brian Johnson

Yes, so follow-up and kind of thinking about that commercial end of the market, are you seeing anything or your dealers talking about anything out of the tax reform not the, not at your level with the cash taxes but small business people, who now enjoy passage adoptions seems to be some improvement around the ability to write-off pickup trucks. So, have you looked at that, what did the dealer saying, would you think that will help about from the - of the market?

Sergio Marchionne

I think that there is an incredible level of optimism that we are taking out from the dealer body, about what the effect to the customer base is and how the customer base is going to react to tax reform in terms of purchasing a new vehicle. So I think overall I expect that Richard made reference to the 17.3 million number, and I keep on being short to the level of granularity that we are using giving you forecast, it’s incredibly access and then pressed.

The 17.3 million reflects I think a level of optimism about the way in which the commercials sort of truck side is going to react and I think 2018 is going to be a good year, I think it’s a first year full tax reform I think you are going to see the benefits. Eventually the system will metabolize the tax rate and this issue will eventually taper into normality, but right now I think 2018 is going to get a boost.

Brian Johnson

Okay, thank you.

Operator

Thank you. we now move on and take our next question from Adam Jonas, from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Adam Jonas

Thanks everyone. Just first a kind of clarification. If I look at the delta of your and net debt moving to the €4 billion net cash and I believe you reiterated and Detroit that, there was nothing one often there that’s true, underlying free cash flow including the increased cash tax as you mentioned. Can you just confirm that because that’s true €6.5 billion of free cash flow you are going to be well above GM and Ford and you are probably nipping at the Germans there, just wanted to kind of laminate that statement?

Sergio Marchionne

The formal statement I can’t comment on a comparison you have made. I mean that I have not analyzed the number Adam, but the number that we gave you, you feel no one us.

Adam Jonas

Okay. Sergio, this is your last full-year. What do you want to be remembered for?

Sergio Marchionne

Being able to answer your questions, Adam.

Adam Jonas

Alright. Then let me finish with something real quick and we will move on. back into 2004 when you were first introduced to the auto industry, a lot of people were thinking who the hell is this guy, right. I was one of them frankly, we hadn’t seen anything like you. You took $2 billion roughly and you turned it into I think around $72 billion and more important than that there are many hundreds of thousands of families across many nations that are better off because of you and your team and you beat this skeptics every step of the way. So I just had to say god bless you, Sergio. We are never going to see any link like you again. I don’t care what people on this call thinking me for saying that, I don’t care at all I just had to say that. Thanks again.

Sergio Marchionne

Thanks, Adam.

Operator

Thank you. We now take our next question from John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

John Murphy

Good morning and good afternoon guys. Just first question, when you say Magneti Marelli, Sergio what you think to be an appropriate leverage ratio there meaning any you talked about $1 billion of EBITDA roughly when you were deteriorate for Magneti, could two to three turns be normal or do you think you kind of shoot a little bit lower than one turn range?

Sergio Marchionne

The answer John is that I don’t know, but the important thing you are going to realize whatever John as we giving on the cash flow does not include any dumping on cash on the same. I forget that I mentioned, did you mention that. The system of our morality is going to the board in February.

So hopefully that the board meeting will be able to tell you exactly what we do because we need to incorporate in the plan of 2018 that we are going to show you for on June 01. But the December 31 cash balance that we showed for us does not include the potential impact of any leverage that will move with morality on this.

So it’s adequate to that number whatever that number may be, but obviously there some gain when you add up morality in FCA at the end of the day. But I don’t know we will do the prudent things and there is no use over levering these things will certainly put whatever that is required by the market that is going to be a mid range leverage position not being extreme.

John Murphy

Okay. And then second question on net price particularly in North America in the fourth quarter you had a real significant positive 130 million Ford was talking about net price down 75 million. So I was just curious what you think is going on in the market that you are able to price so strong and Ford is slipping a little bit and also maybe more importantly that just the fourth quarter as you think about the net price gap in some of your products. Is there more opportunity to simplistically get closer to your competition on price reduce I think you closed that gap at this point?

Sergio Marchionne

I don’t think we closed that I still think we are pricing off the competition not across all segments obviously I think some part of the GE portfolio prices that are premium, but I think we still have pricing gains to be made. I don't know, most of these I think should be recovered in 2018, by the time we finish the 2018.

So I think we'll finish the fourth quarter on par with our competition. In terms of what the other guys are seeing, I think a lot of the pricing issues that you are seeing is mix and not necessarily. I'm looking at Richard, I mean do you think it's purely mix, or do you actually think that there is [indiscernible].

There is pricing pressure on the marketplace, there is a not a singled out. And we have seen in some cases incentives can go up which is negatively, I mean it's some of this, also the residual impacts of inventory overhang that some of our competitors who are try to clear to that. And that probably we have learned early enough in our life and back in 2009 that we will never allow that to happen.

So we have been very, very careful about allowing inventory builds that could not be in our view digested. So we are probably in a slightly better place than most others. We continue to watch, but I don't think we have suffered, I mean we haven't stop for the net price decrease in our -- I think overall.

John Murphy

So there is still room to close a gap a little bit?

Sergio Marchionne

There is. [indiscernible].

John Murphy

Okay. And cost for capacity realignment in 2017 it will not repeat in 2018? Do you guys have a ballpark number I hope you sort of have specific number that we could use?

Sergio Marchionne

The one that Richard gives on [indiscernible] was about €300 million isn’t it. He is now nodding same, and I must have gotten it right it's about €300 million.

John Murphy

That's perfect. And then just lastly, I mean I saw you mentioned of Alfa returning to F1. Just curious what that means for the Alfa brand, what the cost will be. And then for you Sergio, I mean if two children racing each other here. How you kind of take between Ferrari and Alfa in the fight there.

Sergio Marchionne

Well that to be clear. [indiscernible] unfortunately has the not enviable distinction. I think having ranked last in the Formula One last year. So I think many expectation this child will try and take on sort of the contender for the title position of Formula One is a bit optimistic. I think I still have a time to try to make the choice about the children as we go forward.

And hopefully I will no longer be the CEO of FCA by the time that happens. But I will not be conflicted. I maybe emotionally but I'm not in principle terms. The real issue is that I think from an Alfa standpoint, as you all know it has a pretty successful history in Formula One when they race.

I think as we look at the circus in the way in which Formula One is shaping up, I think there is going to be an opportunity for carmakers that we associated with smaller teams. And in fact when you get the name back on the track to race.

Given the magnitude of the forecast that we have on the table for 2018, I don't think the number that were paying [indiscernible] for the sponsorship requires separate disclosure, notwithstanding get that Richard to become so incredibly granular about the results, trying to almost shocking. the numbers, we are not going to move forecast because of the sponsorship. We have enough money to the cover it by the marketing world. So I'm really looking forward to 2018. I think it's going to be an interesting year.

John Murphy

Great. Thank you very much.

Operator

Thank you. We now move on and take our next question from Martino De Ambroggi from Equita.

Martino De Ambroggi

Yes, thank you. Good afternoon good morning everybody. Three quick questions on the guidance for Richard first. You mentioned the dollar assumption is 120, if you could remind us the sensitivity there had a current parameter. Second you mentioned two billion networking capital affected this year, I was wondering what this the underlying assumption in terms of volumes because I clearly understand at the beginning you had this lean of the new models, so for the full-year, I suppose there should be there will be some volume growth underlying and therefore this on the R&D capitalize and what is the balance that you have in your guidance considering in 2017 it was positive by more than 1.1 billion? -

Sergio Marchionne

So in terms of USD sensitivity, have recent a weakening of U.S. dollar and in terms of translation, it’s worth about 60 million negative for translation and there is a smaller impact on transaction as we have about half of the exposure hedged, but basically its about 60 million percent of weakening.

In terms of working capital volume we are growing the business, we have a negative working capital position, so that its basically the answer and we obviously to grow the business throughout 2018. And on R&D the numbers going to come down few under million, but I don’t think that’s all going to change our results from 2018 its all embedded in projection.

Martino De Ambroggi

Okay. and the second question is on for Sergio. I know you already discuss it during the Detroit event, but you changed your view to having that you are not any more looking for a partner? If you could elaborate or for, it is just the matter of the fact that you are in a much better shape, what it was impossible to find our potential interest with partner or what else? Thank you.

Richard Palmer

Both, I mean at the end of the day, you are looking at a balance sheet whether its four billion, five billion, we are now looking like was joining the rest of the, so that the other mode of ranks we were the only leverage that will make here in the world, we are no longer levered and I think we are now fighting with equal arms from a financial standpoint with the competitive view seen.

So that lot progression in operating performance we have identified since we introduced the discussion on capital - and number of initiatives have guaranteed us including something for ones in the U.S. bout reindustrializing the manufacturing footprint. We have identified now a number of initiatives that allowed us to get, well Brian. I asked Joe to show me where we originally show during 2014, I keep up forgetting this.

So when we give you the plan in 2014, we assume that we were going to be debt free, but free but with little cash at the end of 2018. I just remind everybody that we distributed our asset worth 20 billion to the shareholders in the interim. And we are not forecasting a 4 billion cash balance.

So we got a long, long way and I think we have proven this is not just a reflection on me, so reflection on the management team was I think as embraced the project back in 2014 a certain degree of bigger is executing and now and I had to say this but I think executing and almost perfect which is maybe a bit on the stretch, but certainly it’s doing a phenomenal job of executing the plan.

I think that those elements will continue post my retirement that’s why we try to build here since I started this project back in 2004 is a leadership flat that understands what matters in running these businesses and I’m confident that we can continue to execute well which means that the necessity to find the partner to trying the survival going forward is look to bad I mean we are done.

And by the way I go back what I said. I had an opportunity to say this in an interview. Nobody came for the invitations, so it’s no use dreaming in Technicolor about the fact that you are going to lose us. So we are going to run our business and we are going to run hard. I think the 2018 forecast is that indication of what this machine can produce I think every expectation that 2018 to 2022 is going to be of that caliber obviously subject to market conditions, but fundamentally that we continue to execute well.

And it does not take advancing away from the conclusions that were contained in capital junky. Capital junky is accurate today as was back in 2014 and 2015 when I showed it. This is something which is endemic with the industry. All industries which are dis-rely on capital expenditures would benefit from consolidation. You obviously going to hard to figure this out I think most people stud in this common sense.

In an ideal world, people who are rational economically would do it. But this is not an industry which is driven by what I call that highest level of economics rational. So let’s take it for what it is and let’s drive a damn hard and I think that given the parameters of this industry, FCA is well positioned to be a top performer. That’s all I say on that.

Martino De Ambroggi

Okay. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Max Warburton form Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Max Warburton

Yes , hello. Just two questions please. The first one is on the 2018 guidance so I’m very reluctant to sound like on questioning given all the statements so far, but it’s still a huge increase year-on-year some of your competitors and peers. Where were the biggest risks, is this fine to assume that Jeep is the biggest problem there given I think as I look at 2014, Jeep seems to be the business that’s furthest original volume target yet still delivering good profitability. Can we just hone in on what you most worry about 2018?

Sergio Marchionne

In 2019 or 2018 Max?

Max Warburton

Sorry the 2018 number.

Sergio Marchionne

I know you wish you already in the post as you can pick on the next guide, but listen to me. I think that there is - we have had this conversation for about sort of the cruel side of Richard desired to have volume ambitions spelled out a number of cars in our plan which we keep on paying over and over again because where we include a set of one million number into 2014 plan, we have had to explain deviations to that number forever.

The reality is that the Jeep brand and the Ram brand and together Maserati and the others have been well in excess a large profitability ambitions that we had and better than the plan. It allowed us to bring forward a set of numbers which are totally consistent with the 2014 to 2018 plan although on a complete mix that’s in line.

And that by the way it's the way in which we manage this business. We committed to deliver financial results and we got ourselves complete into that and change and modify the execution of the plan and always to guarantee to deliver as a financial results.

I think there is a biggest risk to answer your fundamental question about 2018. And it's a post Q1 event as Q1 is reflects so many startups in terms of Cherokee and the Ram. Their volumes will now really be visible for Q2 to Q4. If that which crew up all those launches, I know we can deliver the volume that are built into the plan, but until nearly €8 billion €9 billion in operating profit that we set for ourselves in 2018.

That’s the real issue is that we can make it. And that we keep on slipping on execution. It's happened before by the way in this industry. We are not - on our own cases we have had instances where some of our startups have been delaying. We have issues moving in to the Cherokee, because of transmission matters. There is a whole part of issues. I think we have derisked most of those choices in 2018, but it's possible. Unlikely, but it's possible.

Max Warburton

Okay. And you said - in 2018 in Detroit. And I wasn't in the room, so I maybe misreported. But you said, if I miss 50,000 Jeeps that I have a private discussion with manually. But if I missed the €9 billion that seems EBIT, we are having a public discussion with all of you and that's not a good discussion. I mean how far short do Jeep fall for the numbers to be at risk?

Sergio Marchionne

To be personally, I don't even know how to answer your question, Max. and I'm not trying to avoid it. Because I don't, it if I miss 100,000 Wranglers I'll fuel the pen. But I have to miss the 100,000 Wranglers which is roughly it's about a third but almost 30% 40% of what the machine will deliver.

So that's that will be painful. But the equivalent to 100,000 Wranglers is, 160,000 Grand Cherokee is it's 300,000 Cherokees. I mean there are multipliers associated with the Jeep portfolio depending on the profitability. So a lot of it is product specific way. But the biggest risk if you have ask this, so I can't produce enough Wranglers within your car.

That's the one that's kind of the biggest profit --. And what's also attached with it there is a global expansion of the Jeep brand because we have been underselling internationally because of a lot of demand than then U.S.

And so it's part of the complicated relaunch strategy of Jeep which embed relatively significant export function of the U.S. into the whole part for the world which have historically short changed because of lack of availability of Wrangler. So it's a complex process, but that's probably the weak point, the weak sister of the package. Everything else are working okay.

Max Warburton

Okay, very helpful. Thank you. And then my last question is just on the succession. You are having this event on the June 1. Are you going to announce the successor there at the same time and if not, why not?

Sergio Marchionne

The answer is not. Because I think we are going to be discussing on the June 1 as the plan. And the plan embeds the collective ambitions of the group of leaders that will be there that they and they've been running this company now for a number of years.

My successor is coming from those ranks. So we don't have to go outside look at other industries we are not that the fashion or aircraft making or anything. We are going to stick with the people, who have been in this business now for a number of years. My successor will be in the room. And to the extent that this reflects the collective ambitions that will be fine.

I mean, twice if we are going to start making hard chocolates starting in 2020, we are going to make cars, which are in line with the brand strategy that we have laid out, the execution of that strategy [indiscernible] response so the challenges that of course but the market will be my successors problem, you all have to adapt to those challenges and as you see here in this particular case, it means it implies significant shift in execution strategy.

We did that in the U.S. when we dumped cars and we embraced SUVs and pickup trucks that was not built into the 2014 plan, that had to be adapted to make sure that we could deliver the numbers and I would expect the same level of dexterity and nimble behavior from my successor.

But he will be in the room, so you will be able to judge from the number of people who maybe presenting that day so what do you think there is somebody who is worthiest of being the leader of the [indiscernible] going forward, I will have a bloody doubt in my mind Max, the leader is in that room.

And I also thought have any bloody doubt Max, that there is more to one leader in that room that could do their job. As the matter of fact I have no doubt Max, that we will believe in not only my successor but the next group. And that to me is equally important, we have enough management left in this house to run those things, well beyond my successors time.

Max Warburton

Right, I think we are all looking forward to the 1st of June, see you there.

Sergio Marchionne

Thank you Max.

Operator

Thank you ladies and gentlemen. We now move and take our next question from José Asumendi from JPMorgan.

Jose Asumendi

Thanks very much. Couple of questions please. Richard can you quantify the realignment charges you took in 2017 in North America and just give us some guidance on that, also if you could quantify how much additional capacity is coming on stream in 2018 in U.S. and roughly how you’re going to utilize the deflation capacity between Ram and Jeep all be it first block and second block beyond the suppliers look for here about the profitability the underlying EBIT margin of [indiscernible] and it was bit early in terms of the planning to yourself. But it does sounds like its ahead of the number you report for component and can you take these 28% margin business in the next two years? thank you.

Richard Palmer

So, the number for 2017 was €450 million for the capacity realignment costs, so we are going to say 300 of that going into 2018, obviously there is still some completion particularly for Sterling Heights. In terms of capacity, clearly we have SAP coming up that plan can produce more light-duty Ram than the previous plant of Warren, I think the numbers about 50,000 more, and then also the new Wrangler coming up in the Toledo North, we can produce about 50,000, 60,000 more Wrangler than that plant, than we go to the predecessor plant, on an annualized basis.

So obviously we are ramping up in 2018, but on a full-year an annual basis those are the deltas in terms of those two key products for capacity. Obviously we will give you a better look of [indiscernible] as we go through the process, we will be discussing as a board as the Bob said earlier.

I don’t see any reason why - through its business plan can’t get to the source of margins that you mentioned and really there are parts of the business that are stronger than other, but I don’t see why it can’t to the 8%. We seen good improvement over the last couple of years, but we give you little more detail because the process of this thing.

Jose Asumendi

Very good. All interest charges was 300 million saw a reduction in 2018 versus 2017?

Richard Palmer

In terms of 150 million, yes.

Jose Asumendi

Right. Perfect. Thank you very much.

Operator

Thank you. We now take a question from Philippe Jean Houchois from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Philippe Houchois

Yes, good afternoon and good morning. Two questions from me. The first one on in the supplement that used to be the most profitable part of yours double-digit, etc and it’s a struggle now to get to those levels for you that for others as well. Is there something that is some of the change in the structure of the economics of South America that we should not expect I mean you certainly got down compared to the previous performance and just wondering I think one of your competitors [indiscernible] kind of hinted that you might be interest in some consolidation there. Do you think that we see consolidation in South America and as a commission to go back to the level of profitability? It is my first question.

Sergio Marchionne

Let me give you answer of the first question. The answer [indiscernible] consolidation is no. It does not where you think Latin America because I wish to consolidate with that’s the first.

Philippe Houchois

Not so particularly you, just in general.

Sergio Marchionne

In general that I think you can find a suitable part of us. I don’t think we are in a dominant position in Latin America and we will continue to hold it. What missing Philippe is a million cars in Brazil. It gives the forecast for 2018 that calls for 2.4 million cars. People forget that market was between 3.4 million and 3.6 million up to 2012 or 2013.

We are missing million cars and we have seen the impact of volume loss of that caliber in the market. We see that in the U.S. when we down for 2017 to 9.5 million cars in 2008 and 2009. So I think we need to be careful. We understand that this business incredibly volume sensitive and when you end up losing that kind of volume support from the market, you end up leaving.

I think we have done a commendable job between our operations up [indiscernible] our recommitment to Argentina that we down to our plant in [indiscernible] into the local market. We have done a commendable job, but we are storing profitability to these levels. I expect that progress to continue as the Brazilian market recovers and I zeal that also happen.

Whether we get to a number like 3.4 million by 2022 I can tell. I think Richard’s view is about us reaching 2.4 million for Brazil in 2018 is eminently do, but certainly based on the forecast that I seen we can probably most likely in excess to that number.

I think the market is recovering from a variety of shops most of which by the way were politically induced. I have to do with the exception that at the level of the president of Brazil and their elections which I’m playing out for 2018 I think going to see clarity as we work our way for the remainder of this year and I think the numbers are relatively safe.

Philippe Houchois

Okay. So your view is we need to get the volume back up to start level there is nothing structurally different that we could not view from going back to very high levels of profitability from the initial footprint?

Sergio Marchionne

Correct. There is nothing that we prevent thus from going back to the double digit performance to the right level.

Philippe Houchois

Okay. And the other question just on housekeeping for Richard maybe as I don’t think you have given us any number on your end of your pension deficit. Any indication where you might be, I think the last number we have something was €9 billion at the end of Q3 for the provision discount rates in [indiscernible]. Can you comment about what the deficit might be pension --? And any kind of reduction in your requirement to put cash into the expansion plans?

Sergio Marchionne

Yes. The pension and [indiscernible] is down slightly because of the exchange. It was slightly up in dollar terms but down the exchanges at €7.6 billion. So some of things a little bit. We had, we did have a discount rate impact in the U.S. the discount rate went down from 4.4% to 3.8%. we also had a very strong asset returns in the U.S. that offset that impact. So it's relatively flat slightly down year-over-year mainly due to exchange.

Philippe Houchois

Okay. So you don't anticipate that you have to put cash in the pension in 2018?

Sergio Marchionne

No, nothing significant beyond what we did already in 2017.

Philippe Houchois

Okay. Thank you very much.

Sergio Marchionne

Thanks.

Operator

Thank you. We now take our next question from Monica Bosio from Banca IMI. Please go ahead.

Monica Bosio

Good morning and good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my questions. I understand that you have - exclusion for FCA. I'm just wondering if you can just give us an indication of what kind of volumes that you have in mind behind the 2018 target? And then if you can give us some flavor for the volume of how kind just some product comments on Alfa as well as F1. Thanks very much.

Richard Palmer

Well I think we are committing to the financial target as we outlined. And then we want to get into discussion about specific volume target for the brands. Brands obviously focused on delivering the financial results that we have outlined.

Monica Bosio

Okay. I do my math, thank you. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. And now a question from Michael Tindall from Citi.

Michael Tindall

Yes, hi. It's Michael Tindall from Citi. Couple of questions if I can. I guess the first one is for Richard. Richard if I look at slide 22 of the deck industrial cost to NAFTA. You got a negative one in forward in Q4. But I can't square that away with what you've reported throughout the year. So I'm just wondering with this some sort of reclassification on the industrial side versus volume and mix?

And then just looking at that negative, is that a one off is that related to perhaps bonuses that you're paying. Or is it a function of we are now building cars that are more expensive. And as a consequence we expect to get better pricing and that's a trade off for that? That's kind of the first question.

The second question relates to CO2, and I'm not sure if perhaps it too early to talk about it. But I wondered if you could agreeing to model your average CO2 was in 2017 in Europe versus the 120 in '16. And in my head where I'm struggling a little bit is the guide is the R&D to go down to CapEx to go down.

And that seems adults with everybody else that is paying up to try and meet the forthcoming CO2 targets. I'm wondering perhaps is it a case of the savings is still big in North America. What is happening in Europe. But if you could talk through that that will be great. Thanks.

Richard Palmer

So in terms of, and just they got enough as you think we have been negative through not the fourth quarter will be high because of the intense activity on completion of the NAFTA realignment and the launches of the some key vehicles, so that’s really the key driver for Q4.

In terms of your question about CapEx and R&D. The answer is yes, I think we have been very clear about how much money we have been spending on the product line of and for Jeep and for Ram and so those are significant projects coming down in terms of activity going into 2018 offset the spending that we are doing on the areas that you mentioned in 2018 and beyond.

Michael Tindall

Okay, thanks.

Operator

Thank you. we now take our next question from Richard Hilgert from Morningstar.

Richard Hilgert

Good morning everyone, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Would like to get your perspectives from the - with the current five year plan. And looking at the windshield into the Vista to come.

On the rear view mirror size, so one or two maybe big items for you that are lessons learned by the organization that really need to be applied and be fundamental to the organization in the next around of five year planning and for Richard, some of your perspectives on the lessons learned on the finance side and the capital structure side, over the past five years.

That need to be applied going forward and how do you see yourself or see that the organization is being capital funded, capital structured and what are the focus areas of funding we have gone from a very owners net debt position to being net cash over the past five years, so that’s been a big focus.

Do we see a change in funding in R&D in capital expenditures, do we start to see dividends. How should we be thinking about the way that the company is going to develop its over arching capital deployment going forward?

Sergio Marchionne

If I can just try and take Richard off the hot seat here, this otherwise he is going to get himself into trouble. This question about what we do with capital structure for the group going forward, best reserve for the June 1 presentation. It needs to go through a scrubbing process with the board which is ultimately responsible for this business, we are going to air all so called dirty laundry or versions of dirty laundry with the board, between now and June 1 that I think Richard will be a lot more comfortable giving you as views on structure and share buybacks and dividends then.

In terms of the things that we have learned a couple of, we have learned here all the time, I mean if known, that U.S. market was going to go two-thirds UVs and pickup trucks back in 2014, than may have saving here few 100s of millions of dollars to try and get that done, I mean - we would have postponed decisions like the Chrysler 200 and maybe the - early enough for the process to try to redevelop our resources to something else.

The good thing about this is the decision to reindustrialize the way in which we have done the paybacks in less than six months, the property executed. So we actually may have been a painful position at the time of the correction mechanism I think made the thing a lot more tolerable that we have been otherwise.

The other thing that I think is that I certainly have learned back to 2014 is that this place is actually and I said that these were parts of the plan. It’s capability of producing leaders that we are sufficiently deep international to remove it around and that’s something that I think we started investing and now halfway to the plan to make sure that we got people who are sufficiently a depth to foreign environment. So we got as what the origins and the Europe, North America and Latin America.

The trial allowed us to have a global reach that allowed us in the set of the table and effectively co-manage those businesses with the CEO of the leadership class. We have invested in that process now I think that you are relatively comfortable that we predicted that and as I mentioned earlier when I was talking to Max I think that we have adequate resources that only my succession that the succession that come after.

But it requires a very careful nurturing of the DNA of the leadership class and I think that we started this process three years ago and I think we are deep enough now to face the net one, I don’t know whether you are going to add anything else to your finance learning. [indiscernible] anything when you the people you just pay them back that’s the rule number one. Richard.

Richard Palmer

I think the other thing is we focus on and we need to continually focus on going for the brand because I think from a financial point of view a dollar spends on one brand is not the same as the dollar spends on another I think something that we have learned I think clear from the way financially performed and need to be maintained as I keep going forward.

Sergio Marchionne

I think that what distinguishes us from the rest I mean obviously the premium brands are very keen on their brands that people will play in that space by the financial spike and protect the brand aggressively. People we have got so the mix back like us which still play actively into that market and have made for raise to the premium side after learning the discipline of keeping these brands distinct and I think we are learning, we have learned a lot and I think we continue to learn and I do that well.

Okay. And then just if I could follow-up briefly, not getting into and feeling any thunder from the June meeting on the finance side. Is it safe to say that with the cash focus no longer meeting to be on the debt reduction side it makes sense that we could see on a percentage basis increased investment in R&D gap wise development capital expenditure along some of these other things that something?

Sergio Marchionne

No, no. No, I’m not keep out saying no we are talking because that’s going to be distinct response of a traditional play in this market. If capital junky is true as this that was based in 2015 we can’t change colors and I think one of the things that came along with being poor, which is a way which we started life back in 2004 and again 2009 is one of the things that you learned is how to do with less. And that's something that we cannot. I have not freaking off, and I think there is nobody on the leadership team that has forgotten what it f1elt like at the time.

Whoever comes after us needs to have the same level of consciousness and the importance of the usage of capital. This is key. Business will kill you if you misuse cash. And when you making cash and you're accumulating it, you view these thing to do, it will start crazy and fast spending it.

So by all means, when you hear about his plan on June 1, you should be the first person to criticize any -- that we creating expansion theory that I designed to conquer the world to the expense of shareholders. I did this obligation that we have is to be fair not only to our people and to the constituency of people whose lives have been interested to us that also big too.

To be fair for the people who provide us capital and to compensate them for their usage. Including share buybacks and the cash accumulation we have to justify it. I’m a proponent of contraction of capital. I think if I can give any advice to my successor and to the board as they should be an integral part of the plan coming forward until 2022. So I'll leave you with that. And then we'll talk on June 1st.

Richard Hilgert

Very good. Thank you very much.

Operator

Thank you. And we now take a question from Lello della Ragione from Intermonte.

Lello Ragione

Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Three left from my side. On free cash flow for the first one. You mentioned about CapEx and working capital. I was wondering especially on the working capital side. You used the fact that the launches of Jeep will change the result pattern that we have meaning negative in the first and third quarter or in the variables integrate the other one.

Or is there any other same pattern that we see in the free cash flow over the course of the quarter in 2018. The other question relates to Alfa. On the Alfa side on profitability if you can comment in the [indiscernible] after the be positive. We understand that we are not still there due to the Chinese and NAFTA deliveries. When we say at this point?

And the other one really on issue of Maserati in China is, I mean we are not seeing for really in deliveries but that we have profitability was quite high. And we are wondering it seems the extended holidays in Italy is the issue is solved especially on. Or you just delivering in the other region for the time being. Thank you.

Richard Palmer

So as we mentioned before, the first quarter are Ram being up the key product. So we are going to see those have impacts from the launches in the volumes of those new products from Q2 onwards. So that's obviously going to impact the free cash flow profile for 2018. In terms of Alfa, we have talked about...

Sergio Marchionne

It’s not profitable in 2018. Let me take Richard off the hot seat here. Still building the brand, obviously the loss was affecting, but we need more volumes. So that's the objective.

Lello Ragione

Maserati in China?

Richard Palmer

Maserati is performing fine in China, no particular issue. We just need to continue to build the performance particularly I think of Levante I think we have done a good job so far, but it’s clear that Maserati is known as a luxury sedan brand in some markets, I’m not sure that the Levante is visible as it could be and we still have room to improve performance. So from a profitability point of view, you saw the year, it was a good performance and we don’t have any inventory issues or anything else - to manage supply manage at this - month.

Lello Ragione

Great, thank you.

Richard Palmer

Thanks.
